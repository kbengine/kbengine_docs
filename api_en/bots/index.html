<h1>Bots process</h1>
Bots is a kind of lightweight client program that simulates and tests the 
server side. Bots has no rendering parts. It can test for hidden bugs and 
apply load to the server through a large number of simulated client and 
server interactions, so that the developer can optimize the service side 
effectively.

<br>
Note: The Bots process needs to implement the relevant client code under scripts/bots, which is extended by a Python script.
